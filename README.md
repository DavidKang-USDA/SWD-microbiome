## Description of R scripts

[Preprocessing](https://github.com/DavidKang-USDA/SWD-microbiome/blob/main/R%20Scripts/Preprocessing.R) - run this script first since it generates input data for the rest of the scirpts
[Diversity](https://github.com/DavidKang-USDA/SWD-microbiome/blob/main/R%20Scripts/Diversity%20analysis.R) - general microbial diversity (alpha, beta and abundance) and statistics
[Network](https://github.com/DavidKang-USDA/SWD-microbiome/blob/main/R%20Scripts/Co-occurence%20network.R)- generating and plotting networks and comparing netwrok between male and female flies
[Differential abundance and Core microbiome ](https://github.com/DavidKang-USDA/SWD-microbiome/blob/main/R%20Scripts/Differential%20abundance%2C%20core%2C%20cooccurence%2C%20%20and%20upset%20plot.R)- differentially abundant taxa across various treatments and core microbial communiites in SWD
